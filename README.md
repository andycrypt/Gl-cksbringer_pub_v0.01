GDI doesn't currently support setting the ActiveCodePage property per process. 
Instead, GDI defaults to the active system codepage. To configure your app to render UTF-8 text via GDI, 
go to Windows Settings > Time & language > Language & region > Administrative language settings > Change system locale,
and check Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support. Then reboot the PC for the change to take effect.
